## RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification

A malignant tumor in the brain is a life-threatening condition. Known as glioblastoma, it's both the most common form of brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year. The presence of a specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation is a favorable prognostic factor and a strong predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy.

Currently, genetic analysis of cancer requires surgery to extract a tissue sample. Then it can take several weeks to determine the genetic characterization of the tumor. Depending upon the results and type of initial therapy chosen, subsequent surgery may be necessary. If an accurate method to predict the genetics of cancer through imaging (i.e., radiogenomics) alone could be developed, this would potentially minimize the number of surgeries and refine the type of therapy required.


### Project Idea & Approach

This project is focused on building or re-implementing neural network architecture that operates on an existing dataset that is already publicly available. Since the project idea was inspired by already closed Kaggle competition, we will try to re-implement some of the most prominent shared notebooks neural networks (including the 1st place Kaggle competition model, which uses 3D CNN), and even build our neural network to improve the state of art. 


### Dataset Description

The data is defined by three cohorts: Training, Validation, and Testing. These 3 cohorts are structured as follows: Each independent case has a dedicated folder identified by a five-digit number. Within each of these “case” folders, there are four sub-folders, each of them corresponding to each of the structural multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans, in DICOM format. The exact mpMRI scans included are:

-   Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
-   T1-weighted pre-contrast (T1w)
-   T1-weighted post-contrast (T1Gd)
-   T2-weighted (T2)
